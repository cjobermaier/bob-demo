# Quarkus AI Integration

This demo shows how to migrate a Quarkus application that exposes REST API logic to also accept chat-like text for similar use cases.

Bob migrates the application to use the LangChain4j framework to connect to LLMs using AI Services and Tools.

If you are interested, you can watch the recording at https://youtu.be/nTQUwghvy5Q to see the running process.

The `Implementation Journey Overview` folder contains all the instructions to reproduce the video, and the `Prompt Templates` folder contains all the prompts used in the demo.
